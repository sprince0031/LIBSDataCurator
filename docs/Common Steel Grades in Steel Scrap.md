## Overview

This document identifies steel grades commonly found in steel scrap recycling operations, providing specific justification for each grade's inclusion based on industry data, recycling volumes, and economic significance. All grades listed have corresponding MatWeb GUID values for materials database integration.

## Carbon Steels (AISI 1000 Series)

### AISI 1018 Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** 3a9cc570fbb24d119f08db22a53e2421

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 1018 represents one of the highest-volume carbon steel grades in scrap streams due to extensive automotive industry usage for body panels, structural components, and fasteners [6]. The automotive industry's annual production of over 80 million vehicles globally ensures substantial end-of-life scrap generation [5]. Additionally, appliance manufacturing utilizes 1018 steel for washing machine drums and refrigerator components, with typical 10-15 year appliance lifecycles creating steady scrap flows [7].

### AISI 1020 Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** a2eed65d6e5e4b66b7315a1b30f4b391

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 1020 steel appears consistently in scrap due to automotive structural applications and construction industry usage for structural tubing and general fabrication [9][10]. The grade's balance of strength, ductility, and cost-effectiveness has made it standard for non-critical structural applications, translating to substantial scrap volumes as infrastructure reaches end-of-life [11].

### AISI 1045 Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** cbe4fd0a73cf4690853935f52d910784

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 1045 steel generates significant scrap volumes through automotive applications including crankshafts, axles, and high-stress components where increased strength is required [12]. Manufacturing industries contribute additional scrap through machinery components and agricultural equipment, with normal equipment replacement cycles ensuring consistent material flows [11].

## Alloy Steels (AISI 4000 Series)

### AISI 4140 Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** 42f0179c4d5d4d49b20feb5ad9370f08

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 4140 steel represents the most commonly encountered alloy steel in scrap operations due to extensive automotive drivetrain applications including crankshafts, connecting rods, and axles [14]. The aerospace industry contributes additional high-quality scrap through aircraft landing gear and engine components, while industrial machinery generates scrap through gears, shafts, and high-stress mechanical components [15][16].

### AISI 4130 Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** 666dfca4fbc74e669b771f35d70a0796

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 4130 steel appears in scrap streams primarily through aerospace applications including aircraft tubing and structural components, automotive suspension systems, and recreational vehicle frames [19]. The grade's excellent weldability combined with good strength characteristics has made it popular in both aerospace and recreational applications, generating specialized scrap flows [19].

## Stainless Steels (T 300 Series)

### AISI 304 Stainless Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** abc4415b0f8b490387e3c922237098da

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 304 stainless steel accounts for approximately 50% of all stainless steel scrap, driven by extensive food service industry usage in restaurant equipment and commercial kitchen appliances [21]. Architectural applications contribute through building facades and decorative elements, while automotive exhaust systems provide additional scrap volumes despite individual component weights being modest [22][23].

### AISI 316 Stainless Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** 172060d502d846dd8cc18785ec397bd0

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 316 stainless steel generates valuable scrap through marine industry applications including boat fittings and propeller shafts, chemical processing equipment, and medical devices [25][26][27]. The harsh operating conditions in marine applications result in relatively frequent component replacement, creating steady scrap flows with premium pricing due to molybdenum content [26].

### AISI 316L Stainless Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** 1336be6d0c594b55afb5ca8bf1f3e042

**Inclusion Rationale:** AISI 316L stainless steel appears in scrap primarily through biomedical implant replacement, chemical processing equipment, and food processing applications where low carbon content is critical [28]. The medical device industry generates high-value scrap through surgical instrument replacement and implant removal procedures, often requiring specialized collection and processing to maintain material certification [28].

## Structural Steels

### ASTM A36 Steel
**MatWeb GUID:** d1844977c5c8440cb9a3a967f8909c3a

**Inclusion Rationale:** ASTM A36 steel represents 60-70% of structural steel scrap by volume, generated primarily through building demolition, renovation projects, and infrastructure replacement [31]. The typical 50-100 year service life of steel-framed buildings creates substantial scrap flows as older structures are demolished, with standardized fabrication resulting in large, clean pieces highly desirable for recycling [32][33].

## Economic and Environmental Significance

Steel recycling provides substantial economic and environmental benefits, with steel recycling saving approximately 74% of the energy required for primary steel production [48]. The proper identification and sorting of specific steel grades enhances these benefits by enabling more efficient processing and higher-quality recycled products [49][50].

## Conclusion

The steel grades documented in this analysis represent the most significant contributors to steel scrap streams based on production volumes, application prevalence, and economic value. Carbon steels (AISI 1018, 1020, 1045) dominate by volume through automotive and construction applications. Alloy steels (AISI 4140, 4130) provide valuable alloying elements despite smaller volumes. Stainless steels (AISI 304, 316, 316L) represent the highest-value scrap component due to nickel and chromium content. Structural steels (ASTM A36) contribute substantial volumes of clean, large-piece scrap highly suitable for recycling operations.
